            <p className = "fact-page-text">Shopping second hand aligns with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goal on Responsible Consumption and Production. 
                By opting for second-hand goods, individuals contribute to reducing waste and the demand for new products, 
                which in turn lessens the environmental impact of manufacturing processes. Additionally, purchasing second-hand items often supports charitable causes, 
                promotes recycling, and fosters a circular economy. Embracing second-hand shopping is a practical way for individuals to make a positive impact on the 
                planet by reducing their carbon footprint and conserving resources.</p>
